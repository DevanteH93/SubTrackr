# SubTrackr 📊

SubTrackr is a subscription tracking web application built with **Next.js** and **Firebase**, created as part of my developer portfolio. The application allows users to organize, monitor, and manage recurring subscriptions in a clean and intuitive interface.

The project demonstrates real-world front-end and backend integration, real-time data updates, and scalable component-based architecture.

## 🎯 Project Purpose
This project was built to:
- Demonstrate modern React & Next.js development practices
- Integrate Firebase for secure real-time data storage and retrieval
- Manage user subscriptions efficiently with live updates
- Showcase responsive, mobile-first UI design

> **Note:** This project is for portfolio demonstration purposes only.

---

## 🚀 Core Features
- Add, edit, and remove subscriptions
- Track subscription costs and next billing dates
- Real-time updates using Firebase Firestore
- Responsive, mobile-first design
- Clean, component-driven UI
- User-friendly dashboards and summary views

---

## 🧩 Tech Stack
- **Next.js** – React framework with SSR and optimized routing
- **React.js** – reusable, state-driven components
- **Firebase** – backend database (Firestore) and authentication
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** – application logic
- **CSS** – responsive styling
- **Git & GitHub** – version control

## 🗂️ Application Architecture
The project is organized to promote maintainability and scalability:

app/
├── components/ # Reusable UI components (cards, forms, modals)
├── login/ # Firebase configuration and utilities
├── app/ # Global and component-level styles
└── public/ # Static assets


This structure separates concerns, improves readability, and makes future expansion easier.

---

## 🔄 Firebase Integration
Firebase is used for:
- Firestore database for storing subscription data
- Real-time updates as subscriptions are added, updated, or deleted
- User authentication (email/password or Google sign-in)
- Environment variable management for security

> All data is stored securely in Firebase, and no sensitive keys are exposed client-side.

---

## 🧠 Engineering Concepts Demonstrated
- Component-based UI architecture
- State-driven rendering and real-time updates
- Server-side rendering (SSR) with Next.js
- Cloud backend integration with Firebase
- Responsive and accessible UI design
- Git-based incremental development workflow
